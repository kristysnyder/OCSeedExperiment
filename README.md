Oliver Canyon Seed Experiment

	The presence and absence of species in the full 3x3 meter plot were recorded (see PresAb, categorical data collected). The overall structure of the community, which includes percent of bare ground, vegetation, littler, and rocks, was also recorded (see Macro, numeric data collected). Nested inside the 3x3 meter plot, a smaller 1x1 meter plot was created, and the percent cover of each species was recorded (see PercentCover, numeric data collected).
